CPU Matrix Multiplication: A Deep Dive
======================================

.. note:: This blog post explores the implementation of matrix multiplication in C. We dive into the concepts and provide code examples to enhance understanding.

Introduction
------------

Welcome to my blog post on matrix multiplication in C. In this post, we'll explore the basics of matrix multiplication and how to implement it from scratch in C.

Key Concepts
------------

Matrix multiplication involves multiplying two matrices to produce a third matrix. Here's a brief overview of the steps involved:

- **Row by Column Multiplication**: For each element in the resulting matrix, multiply each element of the row by the corresponding element of the column and sum the results.
- **Dimensions**: Ensure that the number of columns in the first matrix matches the number of rows in the second matrix.

Implementation in C
-------------------

Below is a simple implementation of matrix multiplication in C:

.. code-block:: c

   #include <stdio.h>

   void multiply_matrices(int a[2][2], int b[2][2], int result[2][2]) {
       for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
           for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
               result[i][j] = 0;
               for (int k = 0; k < 2; k++) {
                   result[i][j] += a[i][k] * b[k][j];
               }
           }
       }
   }

Detailed Explanation
--------------------

Each element of the resulting matrix is calculated by taking the dot product of the corresponding row and column.
